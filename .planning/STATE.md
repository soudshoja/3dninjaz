## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Per-variant pricing (ProductVariant table with S/M/L prices) — must be in Phase 1 schema, not retrofitted
- Init: Server-side PayPal price capture — never trust client-sent amounts
- Init: Handler-level admin auth checks required — middleware alone is bypassable (CVE-2025-29927)
- Init: Stack locked — Next.js 15 + Drizzle + Neon PostgreSQL + Better Auth + Cloudinary + Zustand + Resend + Vercel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Resend email deliverability to Malaysian addresses — needs smoke test during Phase 3
- PayPal Sandbox MYR currency support — verify before building Phase 3 checkout
- SST compliance threshold — confirm with accountant before launch (Phase 4)
